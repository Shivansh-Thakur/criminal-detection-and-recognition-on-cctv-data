Many times, criminals are spotted in the recordings of the surveillance systems but because of lack of technical advancement and lack of manpower, authorities don’t get to know that their surveillance systems spotted any wanted criminal.
Because of this many wanted criminals are free and are left unpunished.

To solve this Problem, our system provide these key features:

1. Identification of a criminal (person) in a video recording corresponding to the uploaded picture of criminal (person).
2. Identification of a criminal (person) in a video recording corresponding to "N" number of small video clip/gif that are to be investigated for the presence of criminal (person) in the uploaded clips.
3. Identification of criminal (person) in a list of known criminals available in our database. 
This can be used to Identify their gangs.
(terrorist groups, etc. in which he/she belongs).

Technology used:

• Python
• Deepface (Python package that contains popular face recognition models)
• Open CV

Future Extension:

• Later on we will try to identify criminals corresponding to their partial face.
• We will be using LSTM to predict the region where crime is going to happen.
